## MERN Stack App: Boba Finder Tracker

### Intro:
- For all boba lovers! An app to search for boba businesses to get that bubble tea fix. 
- Plus, review/track your boba drinks and see what other boba lovers are trying and where.

### User Stories:

#### MVP
- As a user (visitor), I want to search for boba businesses based on location so I can have an exclusive list of boba places to easily choose from.
- As a user (registered), I want to create reviews for boba businesses I have tried and provide additional details for other users to view (recommended drink with sugar level, ice level, loyalty/reward points availability).
- As a user (registered), I can filter by location, name, or drink to view specific boba businesses other users have reviewed.

#### STRETCH 
- As a user (visitor), I would like a button included with the business info to get directions to the business instantly.
- As a user (registered), I would like to view a profile page where I can edit my profile details.
